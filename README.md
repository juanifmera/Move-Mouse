AutoCursorMover
🚀 Welcome to the AutoCursorMover Project! 🚀

This project features a Python script designed to automate the movement of the mouse cursor across the screen. Ideal for those looking to keep their computer active or simulate user activity for various purposes.

🛠️ Project Overview
The AutoCursorMover script randomly moves the mouse cursor to different positions on the screen at regular intervals. This can be useful for preventing screensavers, keeping a system active, or simply automating tasks that require random mouse movements.

🧩 How It Works
Random Position Generation: The script generates random x and y coordinates within a specified range.
Mouse Movement: Uses pyautogui to move the cursor to the randomly generated coordinates.
Interval: The script pauses for 30 seconds between movements to simulate ongoing activity.

🔧 Requirements
Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
pyautogui: A Python library used for GUI automation.
